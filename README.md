## Instructions to Open the Google Colab File

To open the Google Colab file in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Click on the file with the extension `.ipynb` to open it.
2. Once the file is open, click on the "Open in Colab" button located at the top-right corner of the file viewer. This will open the file in Google Colab.

## Running the Code

If you want to run the code in the Google Colab file, follow these additional steps:

1. Make sure you are signed in to your Google account.
2. In the Colab interface, click on "Runtime" in the menu bar.
3. Select "Run all" to run all the cells in the notebook or use the individual cell run buttons.

## Additional Information about Data Cleaning

During the data cleaning process, the following observations were made:

- No inconsistent data formats were found in the dataset.

Data columns (total 12 columns):

| No  | Column                | Non-Null Count | Dtype    |
| --- | -------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 0   | fixed acidity         | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 1   | volatile acidity      | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 2   | citric acid           | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 3   | residual sugar        | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 4   | chlorides             | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 5   | free sulfur dioxide   | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 6   | total sulfur dioxide  | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 7   | density               | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 8   | pH                    | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 9   | sulphates             | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 10  | alcohol               | 4898 non-null  | float64  |
| 11  | quality               | 4898 non-null  | int64    |

All of the 11 input variables are in `float64` datatype, and the output variable "quality" is in `int` datatype. Therefore, no standardization or transformation techniques were applied to the data.
